#1. Write a script that adds 15 and 30 and divides the sum by 2. Print out the answer.
ans = (15+30)/2
print("Question 1")
print (ans)
print ("")

#2. Initialize two variables and use arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder.
var1, var2 = 5,8
print("Question 2")
print (var1+var2)
print (var1-var2)
print (var1*var2)
print (var1/var2)
print (var2%var1)
print("")

#3. Create a variable called name and store your name in it as a string.
name = "Nathan"
print("Question 3")
print (name)
print ("")

#4. Create three variables in one line and assign each one a different food item.

food1,food2,food3 = "Chocolate", "Banana", "Ice cream"
print("Question 4")
print (food1,food2,food3)
print ("")

#5. Print out "Hello" ten times using arithmetic operators.
print("Question 5")
print ("Hello "*10)
print("")

#6. Set your name and age variables in one line with multiple assignment
print("Question 6")
name, age = "Nathan", 37
print (name, age)
print ("")

#7. Create two strings and then create a third variable combining both of the two original strings.
str1 = "Ice"
str2 = "cream"
str3 = str1 + " " + str2
print("Question 7")
print (str3)
print ("")

#8. Create a string and print the fourth letter of the word.
str4 = "qwertyuiop"
print("Question 8")
print (str4[3])
print ("")

#9. Create a string and print the letters from index 0 to 5.
print("Question 9")
str5 = "asdfghjkl"
print (str5[0:5])
print ("")

#10. Create a variable and print all the letters from the first index until the end.
print("Question 10")
str6 = "Mechatronic"
length = len (str6)
print (length)
print (str6[0:length])
print (str6[1:])
